\fs28 1. Use Eclipse to compile and execute the \'93craps.java\'94 file.\
    \'93Output.file\'94 shows the output of the experiment.\
     \'93Details of 5 rounds craps\'94 shows the details of each craps game.

3.   Strategy            Average Ending Balance\
          1                              920\
          2                            1180\
          3                              720\
From the table above, we found  that we got the highest ending balance with strategy 2. So I conclude that strategy 2 ( 
\f1 \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Martingale System
\f0 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 ) works best for me.\
\
(Strategy 2 is high gains and high risk, so if the number of round is relatively small, we can can more gains more easily compared to the other two strategies
\f2 .)
